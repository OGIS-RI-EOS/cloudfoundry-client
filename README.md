Usage Examples
--------------

### Connection and login:

    require "cloudfoundry"
    cf_client = CloudFoundry::Client.new({:target_url => "https://api.cloudfoundry.com"})
    cf_client.login("user@vcap.me", "password")

### Retrieve information from target cloud:

    cloud_info = cf_client.cloud_info()
    cloud_runtimes_info = cf_client.cloud_runtimes_info()
    cloud_services_info = cf_client.cloud_services_info()

### Actions for applications:

    apps = cf_client.list_apps()
    app_info = cf_client.app_info("appname")
    app_instances = cf_client.app_instances("appname")
    app_stats = cf_client.app_stats("appname")
    app_crashes = cf_client.app_crashes("appname")
    app_files = cf_client.app_files("appname", "/")
    app_files = cf_client.app_files("appname", "/logs/stdout.log")
    created = cf_client.create_app("appname", manifest)
    updated = cf_client.update_app("appname", manifest)
    update_info = cf_client.update_app_info("appname")
    deleted = cf_client.delete_app("appname")
    uploaded = cf_client.upload_app("appname", zipfile, manifest)
    zipfile = cf_client.download_app("appname")

### Actions for services:

    services = cf_client.list_services()
    service_info = cf_client.service_info("redis-12345")
    created = cf_client.create_service("redis", "redis-12345")
    deleted = cf_client.delete_service("redis-12345")
    binded = cf_client.bind_service("redis-12345", "appname")
    unbinded = cf_client.unbind_service("redis-12345", "appname")

### Actions for users (some of them require an admin user):

    users = cf_client.list_users()
    user_info = cf_client.user_info("user@vcap.me")
    created = cf_client.create_user("user@vcap.me", "password")
    updated = cf_client.update_user("user@vcap.me", "new_password")
    deleted = cf_client.delete_user("user@vcap.me")
